`manager` provides a set of tools for plotting and analyzing groundwater data as
well as reading data from external sources such as MANAGES and gINT.

## Example
```{r, eval = FALSE}
data <- read_manages3("C:/path/to/Site.mdb")
```

## Installation

To install the `manager` package you must first make sure you have a working 
development environment.  
* **Windows**: Install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  
* **Mac**: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store.  
* **Linux**: Install a compiler and various development libraries (details vary across differnet flavors of Linux).  

Then, install the `devtools` package from CRAN with 
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```
After you have `devtools` installed you can install `manager` using the command 
```R
devtools::install_github("jentjr/manager")
```
Eventually, the package might be submitted to CRAN, but until then you'll have
to install with `devtools`.

## Shiny App

A [shiny app](http://shiny.rstudio.com) is included with the package. It can 
be launched locally by running `manager::manager()`, or you can browse to the
[shinyapps.io](http://shinyapps.io) website for 
[manager](http://jentjr.shinyapps.io/manager). In order to read a MANAGES, or 
gINT database you must be running  a local server with `RODBC` installed. 
`R` must either be in 32-bit, or 64-bit mode depending on which drivers are installed for microsoft access. MANAGER has only been tested in 32-bit mode.
